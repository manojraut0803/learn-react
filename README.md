# Learning React 

## Can I use React without a framework?
```
You can use React without a framework, however weâ€™ve found that most apps and sites eventually build solutions to common problems such as code-splitting, routing, data fetching, and generating HTML. These problems are common to all UI libraries, not just React.
```
## Starting React
```
React (dependencies)    -> React-DOM        (web)
                        -> React-native     (mobile)
        
                    -> Three.js

-> react scripts
    dev
    start
    build
    test
    eject
    lint
cra-template
